    "The keyword `print()` is a *function* in Python.  You can usually identify a function in Python by some keyword followed by open and closing parentheses, i.e. `()`, and possibly one or more *arguments* inside the the parentheses.  In the example above, the argument to the print function is the *string* \"Hello, World!\".  Strings in a programming language are a collection of characters, e.g. [ASCII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII) or [Unicode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode).  You can verify that `\"Hello, World!\"` is a string, by passing it as an argument to the function `type()`."
