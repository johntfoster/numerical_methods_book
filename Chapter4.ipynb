    "## Iterative Methods for Solving Linear Systems\n",
    "\n",
    "Iterative techniques are rarely used for solving linear systems of small dimension because the computation time required for convergence usually exceeds that required for direct methods such as Gaussian elimination.  However, for very large systems, espeically sparse sytems (systems with a high percentage of 0 entries), these iterative techniques can be very efficient in terms of computational run times and memory usage.\n",

    "An iterative technique starts to solve the matrix equation $A\\bar{x} = \\bar{b}$ starts with an initial approximation $\\bar{x_0}$ and generates a sequence of vectors $\\{\\bar{x_1},\\bar{x_2},...,\\bar{x_n}\\}$ that converges to $\\bar{x}$ as $n\\rightarrow\\infty$. These techniques involve a process that onverts the system $A\\bar{x}=\\bar{b}$ to an equivalent system of the form $\\bar{x}=T\\bar{x}+\\bar{c}$. The process then follows, for an initial guess $\\bar{x_0}$:\n",
