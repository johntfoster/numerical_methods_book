    "## LU Factorization (LU Decomposition)\n",
    "\n",
    "Any non-singular matrix $\\mathbf{A}$ can be factored into a lower triangular matrix $\\mathbf{L}$, and upper triangular matrix $\\mathbf{U}$ using procedures we have already established with Gaussian elimination. This proves very useful for numerical computation and is, in fact, one of the most common ways most packaged linear algebra solvers solve non-sparse linear systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Previously, we learned that by using Gaussian elimination we can solve the linear system $\\mathbf{A}\\vec{x} = \\vec{b}$ in $O(\\frac{1}{3}n^3)$ arithmetic operations to determine $\\vec{x}$. It turns out if $\\mathbf{A}$ has the form $\\mathbf{A=LU}$ we can solve for $\\vec{x}$ using a two step process. First we let $\\vec{y}=\\mathbf{U}\\vec{x}$ and solve the system for $L\\vec{y}=\\vec{b}$ for $\\vec{y}$. Since $\\mathbf{L}$ is lower triangular we use a forward substitution process that only takes $O(n^2)$ operations. Once $\\vec{y}$ is known, the upper triangular system $\\mathbf{U}\\vec{x}=\\vec{y}$ can be solved with back substitution in $O(n^2)$ operations. Therefore using this procedure we can reduce the solution of $\n",
    "\\mathbf{A}\\vec{x} = \\vec{b}$ from $O(\\frac{1}{3}n^3)$ to $O(2n^2)$ operations. For large systems this can reduce the calculation time by more than 95%. Determining the $\\mathbf{L}$ and $\\mathbf{U}$ matrices still takes $O(\\frac{1}{3}n^3)$, but it only has to be done for a single $\\mathbf{A}$ matrix and can be used efficiently to solve for $\\vec{x}$ with many right-hand side vectors, $\\vec{b}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We already know one way to transform $\\mathbf{A}$ into $\\mathbf{U}$ by using Gaussian elimination. We will leave the proof for linear algebra class, but we find $\\mathbf{L}$ by performing negations of the same operations on the identity matrix in reverse order. For example when going $\\mathbf{A}\\rightarrow \\mathbf{U}$ if we perform the row operation\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "by performing the second operation on the identity matrix with the same dimensions as $\\mathbf{A}$ we will end up with an $\\mathbf{L}$. I emphasize *an* here because this is only one way to decompose $\\mathbf{A}$ into $\\mathbf{L}$ and $\\mathbf{U}$, there are other methods and an infinite number of $\\mathbf{L}$ and $\\mathbf{U}$ matrices, i.e. they are not unique."

We can prevent this from happening by doing a row exchange with a row that has a nonzero value in the $i^\\mathrm{th}$ column.  Like Gauss elimination there are several pivot strategies that can be utilized.  For simplicity, we will exchange any row that has a zero on the diagonal with the first row below it that has a nonzero number in that column.  Here we have to keep track of the row exchanges by creating a permutation matrix, $\\mathbf{P}$ by performing the same row exchanges to an identity matrix.  This gives a matrix with precisely one nonzero entry in each row and in each column and each nonzero entry is 1.
